# What is [ALB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html) 

AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses. It is a part of AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) services, which also include the Classic Load Balancer (CLB) and the Network Load Balancer (NLB).

The ALB operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and is designed to route HTTP/HTTPS traffic. It can make routing decisions based on the content of the request, allowing more advanced load distribution compared to the Classic Load Balancer.
